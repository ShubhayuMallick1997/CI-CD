## üß† What Is Observability?

**Observability** is more than just monitoring ‚Äî it‚Äôs about understanding **what's happening inside your systems** based on logs, metrics, and traces.

It answers:

* **Is my system healthy?**
* **Why is this request slow?**
* **Where did the error occur?**
* **What was the root cause?**

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Pillars of Observability

| Pillar         | Description                    | Tool Examples          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| üîç **Logs**    | App and system logs            | ELK Stack, Loki        |
| üìà **Metrics** | CPU, memory, HTTP requests/sec | Prometheus, CloudWatch |
| üåê **Traces**  | Request flows across services  | Jaeger, OpenTelemetry  |

## üß∞ Common Monitoring & Observability Tools

| Tool                                        | Purpose                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Prometheus**                              | Metrics collection & querying    |
| **Grafana**                                 | Visualization dashboards         |
| **Loki**                                    | Log aggregation                  |
| **Elasticsearch + Kibana (ELK)**            | Logs and search                  |
| **Jaeger** / **Zipkin**                     | Distributed tracing              |
| **Datadog** / **New Relic** / **Dynatrace** | Full-stack monitoring SaaS       |
| **AWS CloudWatch**                          | AWS-native logs, metrics, alarms |
| **Sentry**                                  | Error tracking                   |
| **PagerDuty** / **Opsgenie**                | Incident alerting and response   |

## üìà Real-Time Monitoring Example with Prometheus + Grafana

### üîπ Setup:

1. Install Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster
2. Install Grafana and connect it to Prometheus
3. Use dashboards to visualize:

   * CPU/Memory
   * Pod restarts
   * HTTP status codes
   * Latency, throughput

### üîπ Sample Prometheus Query (PromQL):

```promql
rate(http_requests_total{job="app"}[1m])
```

---

## ü™µ Logs and Log Aggregation

### ‚úÖ What to Log:

* Errors and stack traces
* Requests and responses (with caution)
* Service start/stop, restarts
* Warnings and unusual behavior

### üîπ ELK Stack Flow:

```plaintext
App Logs ‚Üí Filebeat ‚Üí Logstash ‚Üí Elasticsearch ‚Üí Kibana
```

Or with **Loki**:

```plaintext
App Logs ‚Üí Promtail ‚Üí Loki ‚Üí Grafana (Logs tab)
```

---

## üåê Tracing with OpenTelemetry or Jaeger

> Tracing helps follow a **single user request** as it passes through **multiple microservices**.

Use cases:

* Debugging latency
* Finding bottlenecks
* Root cause analysis

### Example trace includes:

* Start time, end time
* Service A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C timeline
* Failures or timeouts along the way

---

## üö® Alerts & Incident Management

You should configure **alerts for**:

* High CPU/RAM
* 5xx errors
* Slow response time
* Pod crash loops

### Delivery Channels:

* **Slack**
* **Email**
* **SMS**
* **PagerDuty/Opsgenie**

### Sample Alert in Prometheus:

```yaml
groups:
- name: InstanceDown
  rules:
  - alert: InstanceDown
    expr: up == 0
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Instance {{ $labels.instance }} is down"
```

---

## üîê Security Monitoring (Optional Add-on)

* Audit logs (who did what, when)
* Intrusion detection (Falco, GuardDuty)
* Vulnerability scanning
* IAM access alerts

## üß™ CI/CD Observability: Best Practices

| Practice                            | Benefit                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Push build logs to S3 or CloudWatch | Debug failed builds            |
| Show test reports in UI             | Fast feedback                  |
| Notify Slack on failures            | Immediate awareness            |
| Monitor pipeline duration           | Detect performance regressions |
| Export job metrics                  | Find bottlenecks in CI/CD flow |

## ‚úÖ Before Moving to Point 9: Security & DevSecOps

### üìã Checklist

* [ ] Know the 3 pillars of observability: logs, metrics, traces
* [ ] Can set up Prometheus + Grafana or use CloudWatch
* [ ] Can configure alerts for critical metrics
* [ ] Understand distributed tracing basics (e.g., Jaeger)
* [ ] Understand how to monitor CI/CD pipelines themselves

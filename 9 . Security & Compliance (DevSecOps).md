# 🔐 **Security & Compliance (DevSecOps)**

## 🧠 What Is DevSecOps?

**DevSecOps = Development + Security + Operations**

> It’s the philosophy of **"shifting security left"** — meaning you integrate security **early** and **automatically** into the CI/CD process, not after the app is in production.

## 🔍 Security Checks in CI/CD Pipelines

| Type                                           | Tool Examples                           | Checks                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **SAST** (Static Application Security Testing) | SonarQube, Bandit (Python), ESLint (JS) | Code smells, hardcoded secrets     |
| **Dependency Scanning**                        | Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check, npm audit | Vulnerable packages                |
| **Secrets Detection**                          | GitLeaks, TruffleHog                    | Leaked API keys, tokens            |
| **DAST** (Dynamic App Security Testing)        | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite                   | Real-time scanning of running apps |
| **Container Scanning**                         | Trivy, Clair, Anchore                   | Insecure Docker base images        |
| **Infra as Code Scan**                         | Checkov, TFLint, tfsec                  | Terraform misconfigurations        |
| **Runtime Monitoring**                         | Falco, CloudTrail, GuardDuty            | Unauthorized access or behavior    |

## 🔒 Secrets Management in CI/CD

> Never store passwords, tokens, or keys in code or YAML files!

### 🔐 Store Secrets Securely:

| Platform                        | Secret Location                    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **GitHub Actions**              | `Settings > Secrets and Variables` |
| **GitLab CI/CD**                | `Settings > CI/CD > Variables`     |
| **Jenkins**                     | Credentials Manager                |
| **Vault / AWS Secrets Manager** | For advanced use cases             |

### ✅ Use Secrets in Workflows (GitHub Example)

```yaml
env:
  DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
```

---

## ⚙️ Example: Security Checks in GitHub Actions

```yaml
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Scan for secrets
        uses: zricethezav/gitleaks-action@v2.3.4

      - name: Dependency scan with Snyk
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
        with:
          command: monitor
```

## 🔐 Container & Kubernetes Security

| Area              | Best Practice                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Dockerfiles       | Use minimal base images (e.g., `alpine`)    |
| Image Scan        | Run **Trivy** or **Grype** during build     |
| K8s Manifests     | Use `PodSecurityPolicy` or `OPA Gatekeeper` |
| Role-based Access | Use `RBAC` strictly in K8s                  |
| Network Policies  | Isolate pods using `Calico` or K8s native   |
| Image Signing     | Use `cosign` (from sigstore) to sign images |

## 📜 Compliance and Governance

For enterprises or regulated industries, integrate compliance as code:

* 🔍 Audit logs (who deployed what and when)
* 📄 Signed commits or releases
* ✅ Policy checks (e.g., Terraform plans must pass certain rules)
* 🔒 Enforce approvals before prod deploys

Tools: [OPA (Open Policy Agent)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/), [Terraform Sentinel](https://www.hashicorp.com/sentinel)

## 🧠 DevSecOps Mindset

| Traditional Approach    | DevSecOps Approach         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Security after dev      | Security with dev          |
| Manual audits           | Automated checks           |
| Security team is siloed | Security is everyone’s job |
| Annual pen-testing      | Continuous scanning        |

---

## ✅ Before Moving to Final Point: Capstone Projects

### 📋 DevSecOps Checklist

* [ ] Can run static scans (SAST) and dependency scans in CI
* [ ] Know how to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
* [ ] Use secret managers and avoid hardcoded values
* [ ] Can enforce security approvals before deployment
* [ ] Familiar with security tools like Gitleaks, Snyk, Trivy

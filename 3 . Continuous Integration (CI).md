# 🔄 **Continuous Integration (CI)**

---

## 🚀 What is Continuous Integration?

**Continuous Integration** is the practice of **frequently integrating code** from all developers into a shared mainline (usually several times a day). Each integration triggers an **automated build** and **test sequence** to detect issues early.

> 🧠 Motto: **Fail fast, fix faster.**

## 🧱 Key CI Pipeline Stages

A basic CI pipeline performs these tasks:

```plaintext
       Git Push / PR
            ↓
      [1] Checkout Code
            ↓
      [2] Install Dependencies
            ↓
      [3] Lint & Format Check
            ↓
      [4] Run Unit Tests
            ↓
      [5] Build Artifacts (optional)
            ↓
      [6] Upload Test Report / Notify
```

## 🧰 Popular CI Tools

| Tool               | Key Features                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD inside GitHub with workflows  |
| **GitLab CI**      | Built-in with GitLab repos          |
| **Jenkins**        | Highly configurable, on-prem/VM use |
| **CircleCI**       | Great for container-based CI        |
| **Travis CI**      | Easy YAML-based CI for GitHub       |

---

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions: Basic Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
```

## 🧪 Types of Testing in CI

| Type                     | Description                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit Testing**         | Smallest pieces of logic (functions, methods) |
| **Integration Testing**  | Tests how modules work together               |
| **Static Code Analysis** | Linting, code smells (e.g., ESLint, Pylint)   |
| **Security Scans**       | Vulnerability checks (e.g., Snyk, Bandit)     |
| **Code Coverage**        | % of code exercised by tests                  |

---

## 📦 CI Artifacts

> In CI, **artifacts** are files or binaries generated after a successful build.

Examples:

* `.jar` files
* Docker images
* Logs and test reports
* CSV or model output

They can be uploaded to:

* GitHub Actions artifacts
* AWS S3
* Docker Hub or ECR

---

## 📈 Notifications & Logs

CI should notify developers **immediately** if something breaks.

Popular integrations:

* **Slack**
* **Email**
* **Teams**
* **GitHub comments**

## ✅ CI Best Practices

| Practice                   | Benefit                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Commit early, commit often | Smaller diffs, fewer bugs          |
| Fast builds (<10 mins)     | Maintains dev momentum             |
| Fail fast, fix fast        | Saves time                         |
| Test in parallel           | Speeds up pipelines                |
| Use secrets securely       | Never hardcode passwords or tokens |
| Automate everything        | Minimize manual steps              |

---

## 🔐 Secrets & Secure Variables

Store API keys and passwords securely:

* GitHub Actions: `Settings > Secrets`
* GitLab: `CI/CD Variables`
* Jenkins: `Credentials Manager`

```yaml
env:
  AWS_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_KEY }}
```

## 🛠 Real-World Mini Project: Python App CI

✅ Set up CI for a simple Python app:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/python-ci.yml
name: Python CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install Deps
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run Tests
        run: pytest
```

# 🚀 **Continuous Delivery & Deployment (CD)**

---

## 🔄 What Is Continuous Delivery?

> **Continuous Delivery** ensures that every change to your application can be **released safely and reliably** to production at any time — **on-demand**.

Code changes are:

1. **Built**
2. **Tested**
3. **Packaged**
4. **Delivered** to staging/pre-prod environments

But final production deployment may require **manual approval**.

---

## 🚀 What Is Continuous Deployment?

> **Continuous Deployment** is the **next level**: every change that passes all tests is **automatically deployed to production** — **no manual intervention**.

## 📊 CD Pipeline Stages

```plaintext
         ✅ CI Completed (Tests Passed)
                     ↓
         📦 Pull Artifact from Registry
                     ↓
        🧪 Deploy to Dev/Test/Staging
                     ↓
    🔍 Run Integration & Smoke Tests
                     ↓
    ✅ Approval (optional for Delivery)
                     ↓
           🚀 Deploy to Production
```

## 🧑‍💻 Sample GitHub Actions CD Workflow (Docker App to EC2)

```yaml
name: Deploy to EC2

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: SSH & Deploy to EC2
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.0
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
          username: ec2-user
          key: ${{ secrets.EC2_KEY }}
          script: |
            docker pull my-docker-repo/my-app:latest
            docker stop myapp || true
            docker rm myapp || true
            docker run -d -p 80:80 --name myapp my-docker-repo/my-app:latest
```

## 🧠 Deployment Strategies

| Strategy              | Use Case                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Blue-Green**        | Zero downtime switch between 2 environments  |
| **Canary**            | Deploy to a small group first, then roll out |
| **Rolling Update**    | Replace pods/instances gradually             |
| **Shadow Deployment** | Clone traffic to test version, no impact     |

---

## 🔐 CD Environments & Approvals

* Use `environments:` in GitHub Actions or GitLab to manage:

  * Staging
  * QA
  * UAT
  * Production

* Add **required reviewers** for production deploys.

```yaml
environment:
  name: production
  url: https://myapp.com
```

## 📦 Deployment Targets

| Target                 | Method                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **EC2**                | SSH + Docker/Script                |
| **ECS / EKS**          | Push Docker image + Update service |
| **S3 (Static sites)**  | `aws s3 sync`                      |
| **Lambda**             | `aws lambda update-function-code`  |
| **Kubernetes**         | `kubectl apply` or Helm            |
| **Firebase / Netlify** | CLI deploy                         |
| **Heroku**             | `git push heroku main`             |

## 💡 Bonus: GitOps

GitOps is a model where **Git is the single source of truth** for both code *and* infrastructure/state.

CD tools like **ArgoCD** or **FluxCD** watch your Git repo for changes in Kubernetes manifests and sync the cluster automatically.

## ✅ Best Practices for CD

| Best Practice                                          | Why                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Separate build & deploy stages                         | Clear boundaries            |
| Use infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation) | Track changes and rollbacks |
| Keep credentials & secrets out of code                 | Secure deployment           |
| Deploy from artifact registry, not from source         | Immutable and repeatable    |
| Add alerting and monitoring                            | Catch errors quickly        |

## 🧪 Real-World Mini Project: CD with GitHub Actions to AWS EC2

1. Push code to GitHub
2. GitHub Action builds Docker image
3. Push image to ECR
4. SSH into EC2 and pull the image
5. Restart container with new version

---

## ✅ Before Moving to Point 6: Infrastructure as Code

### 📋 Checklist

* [ ] Understand the difference between Delivery and Deployment
* [ ] Can write a CD workflow in GitHub Actions
* [ ] Can deploy to EC2, ECS, or Kubernetes
* [ ] Know basic deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)
* [ ] Understand GitOps for Kubernetes

# 📦 **Artifact Management**

---

## 🧠 What Are Artifacts?

Artifacts are **compiled or generated outputs** of your build process. These could include:

| Type             | Examples                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🧱 Build Outputs | `.jar`, `.war`, `.dll`, `.exe`, `.zip`, `.whl` |
| 🐳 Docker Images | Containerized applications                     |
| 📃 Reports       | Test results, code coverage                    |
| 🧪 Models/Data   | ML models, CSVs, JSON exports                  |

Artifacts are created in **CI pipelines**, stored, and then used in **CD (deployment) pipelines**.

## 🎯 Why Artifact Management Matters

| Without It                    | With It                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Hard to trace what's deployed | Clear build-to-release mapping     |
| No history of builds          | Easy rollback and audit            |
| Inconsistent binaries         | Consistent across staging and prod |
| Security risks                | Signed and scanned images/packages |

## 🧰 Popular Artifact Repositories

| Tool                                     | Use Case                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docker Hub**                           | Docker image registry                                   |
| **AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** | Private Docker image store                              |
| **JFrog Artifactory**                    | Universal package repository (Docker, Maven, npm, etc.) |
| **Sonatype Nexus**                       | Alternative to Artifactory                              |
| **GitHub Packages**                      | Integrated artifact storage (npm, Maven, Docker)        |

## 🐳 Example: Docker Image as Artifact

### 1. Create Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t my-app:v1.0 .
```

### 2. Tag Image for Docker Hub

```bash
docker tag my-app:v1.0 myusername/my-app:v1.0
```

### 3. Push to Registry

```bash
docker login
docker push myusername/my-app:v1.0
```

Now this **versioned artifact** can be used for deployments anywhere!

## 🧪 Artifact Upload in GitHub Actions

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build Project
        run: |
          mkdir dist
          echo "Build Output" > dist/output.txt

      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-output
          path: dist/
```

> You can later **download artifacts** from the UI or in a separate job using `download-artifact`.

## 📦 Managing Python or Java Artifacts

### Python (Wheels)

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

Upload to:

* GitHub Packages
* PyPI (via `twine upload`)

### Java (JAR/WAR)

Use **Maven** or **Gradle** to:

* Generate artifacts
* Upload to **Nexus** or **Artifactory**

---

## 🔐 Artifact Security Tips

* ✅ Use **private registries** for sensitive builds
* ✅ **Scan images** for vulnerabilities (e.g., Trivy, Clair, Aqua)
* ✅ **Sign packages** with GPG or Docker Content Trust
* ✅ Manage access with **IAM** (e.g., ECR policies, Nexus roles)

---

## 📊 Real-World Project Use Case

**Scenario**: A CI pipeline builds a Flask app Docker image and pushes to AWS ECR

```yaml
- name: Login to ECR
  uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1

- name: Build and Push Docker Image
  run: |
    docker build -t my-app .
    docker tag my-app:latest ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
    docker push ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
```

## ✅ Before Moving to Point 5: CD (Delivery/Deployment)

### 📋 Checklist

* [ ] Understand what artifacts are
* [ ] Know how to generate artifacts in CI (e.g., `.jar`, `.whl`, Docker)
* [ ] Can upload artifacts to a registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, ECR)
* [ ] Know how to use these artifacts in later deployment stages
* [ ] Understand artifact versioning, rollback, and security basics

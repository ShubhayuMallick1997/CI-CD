---

## üì¶ What is Git?

**Git** is a *distributed version control system* that tracks changes in source code, enabling **collaboration**, **branching**, and **revertibility** ‚Äî all of which CI/CD pipelines depend on.

> Most CI tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI are triggered by Git events like `push`, `pull_request`, or `merge`.

## üß† Key Concepts in Git

| Concept        | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Repository** | A folder containing your project and `.git` history          |
| **Commit**     | A snapshot of your code at a moment in time                  |
| **Branch**     | A parallel version of the code (used for features, bugfixes) |
| **Merge**      | Combining two branches                                       |
| **Clone**      | Creating a copy of a repository                              |
| **Remote**     | A version of your repo on a platform (GitHub, GitLab)        |

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Git Commands You Must Know

| Action           | Command                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Initialize repo  | `git init`                      |
| Clone repo       | `git clone <url>`               |
| Check status     | `git status`                    |
| Add changes      | `git add .` or `git add <file>` |
| Commit changes   | `git commit -m "message"`       |
| Push to remote   | `git push origin main`          |
| Pull from remote | `git pull`                      |
| Create branch    | `git checkout -b feature-x`     |
| Switch branch    | `git checkout dev`              |
| Merge branch     | `git merge feature-x`           |
| See logs         | `git log --oneline`             |

## üåø Git Branching Strategies

In CI/CD, **branching strategy defines when and how pipelines run**.

### 1. **GitFlow**

* `main`: Production-ready code
* `develop`: Integration branch
* Feature branches: `feature/*`
* Releases & hotfixes use `release/*` and `hotfix/*`

### 2. **Trunk-Based Development**

* Short-lived branches
* Merge frequently into `main`
* Ideal for fast-moving teams and CD

### 3. **GitHub Flow**

* Create branch ‚Üí PR ‚Üí Merge to `main`
* Trigger deploys automatically

> Most modern teams use **GitHub Flow** or **Trunk-Based** with automation.

## üîê Pull Requests (PR) & Code Reviews

| Step                             | Role     |
| -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Developer creates feature branch | Dev      |
| Pushes code and opens PR         | Dev      |
| Reviewer checks for issues       | Reviewer |
| Comments, suggestions added      | Reviewer |
| Merge after approval             | Lead/Dev |

> Most CI/CD pipelines run automated tests and checks during **PR stage**.

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Tags and Releases

### Tags

* Mark specific commits (like v1.0.0)
* `git tag v1.0.0`

### Releases

* GitHub/GitLab allow you to publish releases with artifacts (zips, changelogs)

---

## üö® GitHub Actions Integration Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
```

## üß© Best Practices for Git in CI/CD

* Use **semantic commit messages** (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
* Keep commits small and meaningful
* Use PR templates and enforce reviews
* Don't commit secrets (use `.gitignore`)
* Use protected branches for `main`, `release`, etc.

## üéì Tools You Can Practice With

| Tool                   | Purpose                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Git CLI                | Local version control   |
| GitHub                 | Most popular Git remote |
| GitLab                 | CI/CD + Git             |
| Bitbucket              | Git + pipelines         |
| Sourcetree / GitKraken | GUI for Git             |

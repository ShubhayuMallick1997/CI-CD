## 🎯 Project 1: Flask App Deployment with Docker & GitHub Actions

\| Stack | Flask, Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS EC2 |
\| Focus | CI, Docker build, CD to EC2 via SSH |

### Key Steps:

1. Build a simple Flask app
2. Dockerize the app with a `Dockerfile`
3. Push code to GitHub → CI pipeline triggers
4. Build Docker image → push to Docker Hub
5. SSH into EC2 → pull image → run container

📂 Bonus: Add **Trivy scan** and **pytest** to CI pipeline.

## 🚀 Project 2: Kubernetes App Deployment with GitOps

\| Stack | React frontend + Node backend + MongoDB |
\| Focus | CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Helm, ArgoCD, EKS or Minikube |

### Key Steps:

1. Dockerize frontend, backend, Mongo
2. Write Kubernetes YAMLs or Helm chart
3. GitHub Actions pushes to Git → ArgoCD syncs to K8s
4. Add auto-rollbacks, versioned deployments

📂 Bonus: Use `Prometheus + Grafana` to monitor pods & API latency.

---

## 📦 Project 3: Terraform + AWS CI/CD

\| Stack | Terraform, S3, EC2, IAM, GitHub Actions |
\| Focus | Infra as Code + Deploy static app or container |

### Key Steps:

1. Use Terraform to provision:

   * EC2 + Security Group
   * S3 Bucket + Website hosting
2. GitHub Actions pipeline:

   * `terraform apply`
   * Upload frontend build to S3
   * Notify Slack on success

📂 Bonus: Use `Checkov` to scan Terraform code for security flaws.

---

## 🔐 Project 4: Secure Java App CI/CD

\| Stack | Java + Maven, SonarQube, Snyk, Docker |
\| Focus | Full DevSecOps Pipeline with Security Scans |

### Key Steps:

1. Create a Spring Boot app
2. Write GitHub Action to:

   * Run `mvn test`
   * Analyze code with **SonarQube**
   * Scan dependencies with **Snyk**
   * Package `.jar` → Dockerize
3. Push to DockerHub + Deploy to ECS or EKS

📂 Bonus: Configure **Slack alerts** on test failure or image vulnerabilities.

---

## 🧠 Project 5: End-to-End CI/CD + Monitoring Stack

\| Stack | Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana |
\| Focus | CI/CD + Monitoring + Alerting |

### Key Steps:

1. Create an Express API with `/health`, `/orders`
2. CI pipeline: test → Docker → push to ECR
3. CD pipeline: apply K8s manifests via GitHub Actions
4. Expose metrics via Prometheus format
5. Monitor with Grafana dashboard

📂 Bonus: Set alert for 5xx errors > 2% or latency > 200ms

---

## 🌐 Project 6: Multi-Env CI/CD with GitHub Environments

\| Stack | React app deployed to S3 |
\| Focus | Deploy to Dev → UAT → Prod with approvals |

### Key Steps:

1. Define GitHub environments: `dev`, `uat`, `prod`
2. Add manual approval for `prod`
3. CD pipeline:

   * Build React
   * Upload to environment-specific S3 buckets
   * Invalidate CloudFront cache

📂 Bonus: Add performance audits using **Lighthouse CLI**

# 🧱 **CI/CD Foundations**

Understanding **why CI/CD exists**, its **goals**, and how it fits into modern software development is critical before jumping into tools or writing YAML pipelines.

---

## 🔍 What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for:

* **CI – Continuous Integration**
* **CD – Continuous Delivery** (or **Deployment**, depending on context)

Together, they aim to **automate** and **streamline** the process of getting code **from developer to production**.

## 🧠 Why Is CI/CD Important?

| Without CI/CD                   | With CI/CD                        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Manual builds and deploys       | Automated builds & deploys        |
| High risk of bugs in production | Early detection through testing   |
| Long release cycles             | Frequent, smaller releases        |
| Poor collaboration              | Continuous feedback & integration |

## ✅ CI vs CD Explained

### 🔄 Continuous Integration (CI)

> Automatically **integrate** new code into a shared codebase multiple times per day.

#### Main Activities:

* Code is pushed to the main repo
* Triggers build/test pipeline
* Feedback is immediate

#### Key Goals:

* Avoid integration hell
* Catch bugs early
* Improve team collaboration

---

### 🚚 Continuous Delivery (CD)

> Automatically **deliver** tested and validated code to a **staging** or **production-like** environment.

#### Key Activities:

* Deploy to test/staging environment
* Perform additional checks (QA, integration, manual approvals)
* Optionally trigger production deploy

> The release is **ready anytime**, but **manually** pushed to production.

---

### 🚀 Continuous Deployment (CD)

> Goes one step further — **automatically pushes** code to **production** after passing all tests.

> No human approval is needed (for true continuous deployment).

## 📊 CI/CD Pipeline Overview

A basic pipeline generally looks like this:

```plaintext
        Developer Commit
               |
         [CI] Code Checkout
               |
         [CI] Unit Tests
               |
         [CI] Code Linting
               |
         [CI] Build Artifact (e.g., JAR, Docker)
               |
         [CD] Deploy to Staging
               |
         [CD] Manual/Auto Approval
               |
         [CD] Deploy to Production
```

## 🔑 Key Terminologies to Know

| Term             | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pipeline**     | The sequence of automated steps (build, test, deploy)   |
| **Stage**        | Logical phase in a pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy) |
| **Job**          | A task (e.g., run tests, build Docker image)            |
| **Trigger**      | Event that starts a pipeline (e.g., `git push`)         |
| **Runner/Agent** | The machine that executes pipeline tasks                |
| **Artifact**     | Final build output (e.g., `.jar`, `.zip`, Docker image) |

## 🧩 Benefits of CI/CD

* 🧪 **Early bug detection** via testing
* 🔄 **Faster feedback loops** for developers
* ⏱️ **Reduced deployment time**
* 🚀 **Accelerated delivery velocity**
* 🤝 **Improved team collaboration**
* 🔒 **Better security and compliance** with automated checks

---

## 🗺️ What You Should Be Comfortable With Before Moving to Step 2

✅ Understand:

* What is CI, CD (delivery vs deployment)?
* Why do we use pipelines?
* Common terms: jobs, runners, artifacts
* Manual vs automated releases
